<p>One of the first reliable accounts of the existence of vampires is Bram Stoker&rsquo;s <em>Dracula</em>. Let us assume that Count Dracula was the first vampire, and that he was the alive in 1897 when the novel was published.</p>
<p>Once a month (at Full Moon) vampires have to drink the blood of a human; their victims die and are transformed into vampires themself. This means, if Dracula was the only vampire in January 1897, there were two vampires in February. That month they both went hunting, killing two more humans so that there were four vampires in March. Every month the number of vampires doubles, eight in April, 16 in May, and so on.</p>
<p>During 1897, the number of vampires doubles 12 times, and increases by a factor of 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2 = 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096. During 1898 the number of vampires increases by the same amount &#8211; this makes 16777216 vampires by 1899.</p>
<p>From 1897 until 2013 there are 116 years, or 116 &times; 12 = 1392 months. If the number of vampires doubles every month, this means there must be</p>

<p>vampires today. This number is many times larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe, and completely unrealistic even if every one of the 7 billion (7000000000) people on Earth were a vampire. (Are you?)</p>
<p>The only conclusion is that vampires don't exist.</p>

<h2>Predators and Prey</h2>

<p>This argument is comforting and reassuring, but unfortunately it is incorrect. As the number of vampires increases, they have fewer humans to prey on. In addition, some vampires will die from sunlight, garlic or decapitation. This gives the population of humans time to grow, until there are enough humans

<p>Let <em>H</em>(<em>t</em>) be the number of <strong>H</strong>umans at time <em>t</em>, and let <em>V</em>(<em>t</em>) be the number of <strong>V</strong>ampires at time <em>t</em>. We know that there was only one vampire in 1897, so <em>V</em>(1897) = 1, and the human population in 1897 was <em>H</em>(1897) = 1.5 billion.</p>

<p class="todo"></p>

<p>These equations are called <strong>differential equations</strong> because they consist not only of the variables <em>H</em> and <em>V</em> but also the <em>rate of change of H</em> and the <em>rate of change of V</em>. Rates of change are often denoted as <span class="sfrac"><span class="sfractop">dH</span><span class="sfracbot">dt</span></span> and <span class="sfrac"><span class="sfractop">dV</span><span class="sfracbot">dt</span></span>; the <em>difference</em> in humans over time and the <em>difference</em> in vampires over time.</p>

, thereby contaminating their victim and transforming them into another vampire.
